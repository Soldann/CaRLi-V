# CaRLi-V: Camera-RADAR-LiDAR point-wise Velocity estimation

Accurate point-wise velocity estimation in 3D is vital for enabling robot interaction with non-rigid dynamic agents such as humans, enabling robust performance in path planning, collision avoidance, and object manipulation in dynamic settings. To this end, we propose a novel RADAR, LiDAR, and camera fusion pipeline for point-wise 3D velocity estimation named CaRLi-V. This pipeline leverages a novel RADAR representation, the velocity cube, which densely represents radial velocities within the RADAR's field-of-view. By combining the velocity cube for radial velocity extraction, optical flow for tangential velocity estimation, and LiDAR for dense point-wise localization measurements through a closed-form formulation, our approach can produce detailed velocity measurements for a dense array of points. This repository comprises of a ROS2 package for 3D dense point-wise velocity estimation using a camera, RADAR, and LiDAR fusion framework.
